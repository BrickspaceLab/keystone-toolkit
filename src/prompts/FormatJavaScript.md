1. Indentation:

   - Use consistent indentation throughout the code (2 spaces)
   - Indent nested elements properly to improve readability

2. Braces and Parentheses:

   - Place opening braces on the same line as the statement or declaration
   - Use a single space before the opening brace
   - Place closing braces on a new line
   - Use a single space after keywords like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.
   - Do not use spaces inside parentheses

3. Semicolons:

   - Always use semicolons at the end of statements

4. Comments:

   - Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious code sections
   - Use comments to describe the purpose or functionality of specific functions or blocks of code
   - Use single-line comments (`//`) for brief comments
   - Use multi-line comments (`/* */`) for longer comments or to temporarily disable code

5. Naming Conventions:

   - Use camelCase for variable and function names
   - Use PascalCase for constructor functions and class names
   - Use UPPERCASE for constants
   - Use descriptive and meaningful names

6. Whitespace:

   - Remove unnecessary whitespace, such as trailing spaces or multiple blank lines
   - Add appropriate spacing around operators, commas, and after keywords
   - Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code

7. Line Length:
   - Limit line length to a maximum of 80 characters for better readability
   - If a line exceeds the limit, break it into multiple lines and indent accordingly
